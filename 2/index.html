                <p>Communist design during the Cold War era reflected the values of collectivism and socialism in contrast to the consumerism prevalent in capitalist societies. It was often used to promote communist ideology and visually represent the ideological goals of the state. Particularly in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, artwork such as posters, sculptures, and architecture emphasized icons and symbols of the socialist revolution. These works highlighted the power of the people and the ideals of socialism, using subdued and sober color palettes to convey ideological messages.</p>

                <p>In contrast, capitalist design during the Cold War era emphasized the values of liberalism, individualism, and consumerism. It prioritized commercial objectives and meeting consumer desires. Especially in the United States and Western European countries, design elements such as vibrant color palettes and innovative typography were used to enhance the visual appeal of products and advertisements. These designs served as symbols of freedom, innovation, and prosperity, often used as part of marketing campaigns to emphasize economic success and competitiveness in the market.</p>
